Circles</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">    The radius (r) of a circle is the distance set on your compass when you draw a circle, and the distance from the center to the boundary of any circular object. The distance around, or perimeter, is called the circumference (C), and the straight-line distance across the circle, through the center, is called the diameter. The diameter (d) is exactly twice the radius. There is a fixed ratio between the circumference (C) and the diameter (d), expressed algebraically as C/d. What, exactly, is the value of this ratio?</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">    The number must be less than 4, because the perimeter of a square that encloses a circle is 4d.  See Figure 5-1. The number must be greater than 3, because when 6 radii are marked off on the circumference, the straight-line figure inside is a regular hexagon, with perimeter 3d.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">    Archimedes of Syracuse (Sicily, not New York) was curious about the precise ratio between  C and d. Around 250 BC, he had no calculator and not even a good number system, but by constructing polygons with more-and-more sides, and dividing them into triangles, he found a good approximation of the number, which about 1700 AD came to be called pi (<span class="T1">p</span>) the 16th letter of the Greek alphabet.</p><p class="P2">                              </p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">                            </span>C/d  = <span class="T1">p</span>,        C = <span class="T1">p</span> d = 2 <span class="T1">p</span><span class="T3"> r</span></p><p class="P1">                              </p><p class="P1">                         3 1/7 = 22/7 &gt; <span class="T1">p</span> <span class="T3">&gt; 3 </span>10/71= 223/71</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="Standard"><span class="T4">    The ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle (</span><span class="T5">p</span><span class="T4">) is given here as approximately 3 1/7, which is the same as 22/7. It is possible to have fractions between any two whole numbers, not just between 0 and 1. In principle, the interval between 3 and 4 could be divided in 71 equal pieces, and we could take 10 of them to make the desired ratio. Thus </span><span class="T5">p</span><span class="T4"> is also about 3 10/71. </span></p><p class="P6"> </p><p class="P6">     Although fractions can be precise, and operations with fractions have simple, well-defined rules, it is often more practical to do calculations with their decimal equivalents: ¼ = 0.25, 1/8 = 0.125, 1/16 = 0.0625 etc. The decimal equivalent of a fraction is the upper number (numerator) divided by the lower one (denominator).</p><p class="P7"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Exercise 5-1. Find the decimal equivalents of the Archimedes fractions.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">     An average of these two values is very close to the desired ratio.  A closer ratio, 355/113, was known to ancient Chinese astronomers. The value in a scientific calculator is 3.141592654. By playing with numbers, one can find</p><p class="P1">fractions even closer, such as 12 546 274/3 993 603.</p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">    The value of <span class="T1">p</span> can be calculated ever more closely by adding various series of ever-smaller fractions (discovered by Leibniz and Euler), a tedious procedure ideally suited to computers. Some people have become so obsessed with <span class="T1">p</span><span class="T3"> </span>that they carry calculations to ridiculous extremes. That is why <span class="T3">pi </span>is called an irrational number. No, not really; it is because there is no ratio of whole numbers that expresses it exactly. </p><p class="P1"> </p><p class="P1">Exercise 5-2.</p><p class="P1">1 .
