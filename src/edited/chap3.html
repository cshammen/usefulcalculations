<div title="Numbers">
<p>The numbers we now use originated in India, spread to Syria and
Arabia, reached Italy after hundreds of years, and were first
''publicized'' by Leonardo of Pisa in 1203. Recognizing their great
superiority over Roman numerals for calculating, European scholars
quickly adopted the Indo-Arabic numbers, which led to universal
acceptance a mere 300 years later. What a beautiful example of cultural
lag! Roman numerals are still used for corner-stone dates of buildings,
copyright dates in books, hours on faces of clocks, and the sequence of
Olympic Games and Super Bowls.</p>

<p>The symbols: I = 1, V = 5, X = 10,  L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M =
1 000. The numbers, printed from left to right in decreasing value, are
added, except that when a smaller precedes a larger, it is subtracted;
for example: XI = 11, and IX = 9; LX = 60, and XL = 40; CX = 110, and XC
= 90.</p>

<p>A defect of the Roman system, and of our present system as well,
until about 1300 AD, was the lack of zero. A figure that stood for
''nothing'' was repugnant to the ancient Greeks. To hold a place in a
long number, however, zero is ideal. To add up segments of a trip,  it
makes good sense to call the starting point 0 and the first stop 1. The
monk who invented B.C. and A.D. did not know zero, so he omitted year
zero, setting up a confusion about the beginnings of centuries and
millenia that is still with us. For example, did Augustus Caesar (63BC -
14AD) live to age 76 or 77? It is clear that a number line consists of a
zero point with positive numbers extending to the right, and negative
numbers to the left.</p>

<p>The binary number system was a 1697 idea of  Leibniz. It turned
out to be highly useful. Expressed entirely with 1 and 0, the system is
based on powers of 2. It starts at the right end with 2<sup>0</sup> = 1,
then 2<sup>1</sup> = 2, 2<sup>2</sup>= 4, 2<sup>3</sup> = 8, and so
forth. For example, 1101 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13, because the 0 indicates that
2<sup>1</sup> is not present. If the meaning of 2<sup>0</sup> or 2<sup>1</sup>
is not clear, review the rules of exponents.  The binary system is
especially useful in computers; an electrical switch is either <i> on</i>
or <i>off</i>. There are 10 kinds of people in the world, those who
understand binary, and those who don't.</p>

<p>The oldest number system is the sexigesimal (base-60) system used
by accountants and astronomers of Sumer more than 5 000 years ago. The
figures belong to archaeology, but significant remnants of the system
are found in the 60-second minute, the 60-minute hour, the 24-hour day,
the 90-degree right angle, l80-degree hemispheres, and 360-degree
compass. The beauty of this system is the extraordinary number of
factors; 60 is divisible into whole parts by every number up to 12,
except for 7 and 11. There is no sign that base-60 will ever disappear.</p>

<div title="Letters">
<p>Roman use of letters to signify numbers apparently came from the
Greeks, not from Latin letters. One could say that ideas and reasoning
came from the Greeks, and that Rome built an empire by adding a strong
army and efficient tax collection. Teaching of the Greek language has
virtually disappeared, but it is still useful to know the alphabet. The
word alphabet comes from &alpha; and &beta;, and an extraordinary number
of English words have Greek roots. All 24 Greek letters except for
&iota; (iota) and &omicron; (omicron) are used regularly in math and
science. Some standard examples are: the angle &theta; (theta),
&lambda; (lambda) for wavelength, and &nu; (nu) for frequency. When you
go to Athens, and climb the steps of the Acropolis
(&alpha;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;/[akro] = high,
polis/&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&sigma;/[polis] = town), you will be able to
read the admission ticket (Figure 3-1), and the street signs in the
Plaka below.</p>

<p>  Some words, like 'ubris and 'orizon, have entered the English
language unchanged, except for addition of the letter h, which is not in
the Greek alphabet. The elevated comma indicates the ha sound; H is the
letter eta, the long e. All the letters have names, which are used in
crossword puzzles, and in naming fraternities and sororities. On the
Acropolis ticket and other similar tickets, below the standard numbers
are two-letter abreviations of their names.</p>

<p>Some advice, attributed to the priests of Apollo at Delphi: <span
	class="T20">MHDEN</span> <span class="T20">AGAN</span>.</p>

<p>This is literally “Nothing too much”, and is found in Latin
literature as <span class="T31">NIHIL NIMIS</span>, nothing in excess,
moderation in all things. Political <span class="T20">DHMOKRATIA</span>
originated in Athens. A favorite put-down of the elite is to assign
someone to</p>

<p>'<span class="T20">oi polloi </span>= the many, the masses, the
common people.</p>

<p>The accepted date for the first Games at Olympia, Greece is 776
BC. All pagan cults were banned in 393 AD. Held every four years, that
makes: 1169 / 4 = 292 Games. The modern Games began in 1896, which makes
the 2004 Athens Olympiad: 2004-1892 (year zero) = 112 / 4 = XXVIII.</p>
