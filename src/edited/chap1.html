<div title="BMI Calculation">

<p class="bodytext">Young adults of the human species grow to a certain height, then cease to grow. Body weight, however,
can be controlled, within limits. A slender body, apart from looking good in clothing (and without) confers a definite health
advantage, according to several long-term studies. Life insurance companies have known for at least 50 years that thinner
people have lower mortality rates. A 1959 table of desirable weights for particular heights shows that, for example, a woman
155 cm (centimeters) tall should weigh no more than 48.5 kg (kilograms). These dimensions are equal to 5 feet 1 inch and 107
pounds. Modifications of such tables are still published, but since 1990, health professionals have used body-mass-index
(BMI), which is in units of kilograms per square meter.</p>

<p class="bodytext">If your bathroom scale lacks read-out in kilograms, you can either (1) buy a new scale, or (2) use
your calculator to divide your weight in pounds <span class="italics">by</span> the conversion factor 2.20462 pounds per kg.
Thus your weight in kg is less than half your weight in pounds, and you have already made progress in your weight-loss
program. No, not really, but you are getting better at arithmetic. To convert 154.3 lbs to kg:</p>

<p class="equation">154.3 lbs / 2.20462 = 70.0 kg</p>

<p class="bodytext">The 70-kg man was once the standard in medical physiology, probably because medical students were a
good source of human subjects for testing, and they were all young males of average weight and height.</p>

<p class="bodytext">The next step in calculating the BMI is either (1) to measure the person's height in meters, or (2)
to convert inches to meters by dividing inches<span class="italics">by</span> 39.37 in/m. For example, a person exactly 5
feet 8 inches tall:</p>

<p class="equation">68.0 in / 39.37 = 1.727 m</p>

<p class="bodytext">In a class exercise, 37 female college students reported an average height of 1.635 meters , and 16
male students reported 1.792 m. If your height differs greatly from these, check your calculation.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Now, one must square the height, which is done easily by entering the number, and pressing the x<sup>2</sup>
button:</p>

<p class="equation">(1.727 m)<sup>2</sup> = 2.9825 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p class="bodytext">And the final step is:</p>

<p class="equation">70.0 kg / 2.9825 m<sup>2</sup> = 23.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> = BMI</p>

<p class="bodytext">A healthy BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.  Numbers from 25 to 29.9 indicate
overweight, and a BMI greater than 30 indicates obesity . However, some athletes have BMI greater than 30, because of greater
muscle mass, and they are not considered unhealthy.</p>

</div>
<div title="Rounding">

<p class="bodytext">In calculations of this sort,  the number of figures in the original data determines the number in
the result, and the rule is to use all the figures available, and round off in the final step . With three significant
figures, a number such as 20.06 is rounded up to 20.1, and 20.04 is rounded down to 20.0. If the last number to the right is
5, one rounds to the nearest even number; thus both 20.15 and 20.25 become 20.2 when rounded, and bias is avoided.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p><b>Exercise 1.</b> Get accurate measurements of your weight and height, and calculate your body mass index. Convert
the data in Table 1 to metric units, calculate BMI for each man, and classify them as normal, overweight, or obese.</p>

<div title="BMI and Health">
<p class="bodytext">Health experts agree that a combination of more exercise and less intake of fatty foods is needed to
combat obesity. The importance of maintaining a <a
	href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/obesity/lose_wt/index.htm"> healthy weight </a> in order to reduce health
risks has been well publicized<!-- (Figure
1-1)(figure replaced with link) -->.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Increases in BMI with age have been observed often, but they are apparently <span class="italics">not</span>
inevitable. Increases in BMI during pregnancy <span class="italics">are</span> inevitable, because the average full-term baby
weighs 3.40 kg, and the placenta and fluids weigh 6.80 kg. The physician allows a woman with normal BMI to gain 10.20 kg
during pregnancy. In his newspaper column of 23 January 2002, Dr. Paul G. Donohue recommended that a woman with BMI less than
19.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> be allowed to gain more than 10 kg, and a woman with BMI above 26 be advised to limit weight gain to 9
kg or less.</p>

<p class="bodytext"> Another ratio, suggested by diet and nutrition writers, supplements the BMI. The circumference or
distance around the waist is compared with the like measurement of the hips. The ratio waist/hip should be less than 0.80 for
women, and less than 0.95 for men. For example: 86cm / 96cm = 0.90 is OK for a man. A healthy woman is expected to have a
smaller waistline.</p>
