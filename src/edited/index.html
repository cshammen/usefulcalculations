		<p>The purpose of this work is to promote fluency in the language
			of mathematics among students who have had little experience (or
			perhaps an unpleasant experience) with standard math courses. Every
			educated person needs to become “numerate”, not only to solve
			practical problems, but also to develop paths of communication with
			scientists, physicians, and engineers, whose work requires that they
			think in a quantitative manner.</p>
		<p>Elements of algebra and geometry are introduced in order to
			solve problems, not as preparation for further study. Natural
			logarithm and a calculus expression are included in order to explain
			quantitative aspects of population growth, radioactive decay, and
			light in the sea. Exercises embedded in the text make use of real
			data, or numbers that closely resemble real data. Examples show the
			usefulness of math in elementary biology, chemistry, and physics.</p>
		<p>The strategy is to become adept with a scientific calculator,
			in order to attack interesting problems that have numerical answers.
			The power and beauty of exponents, and the features of a good graph,
			are made apparent. Familiarity with the Systeme International is
			promoted, so as to facilitate discourse with scientific and medical
			people at home, and with the general public in other countries.</p>
