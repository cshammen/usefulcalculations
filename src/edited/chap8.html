		<p>The body of a woman with a weight on her head resembles a
			column or cylinder, as the architect of the Erechtheion must have
			recognized when he supported the top of the temple (the entablature)
			with caryatids (Fig. 8-1). Unlike these statuesque girls, a real live
			woman consumes food and oxygen, and loses heat to the environment at
			a measurable rate; she has a metabolism. One variable that correlates
			well with metabolic rate is body surface area. Let us consider the
			surface areas of several solid figures, and compare them to human
			dimensions and body surface area.</p>
		<p>
			The volume of a cube is simply the length of one edge, cubed : Vc = L<sup>3</sup>.If
			the edge is 37 cm, the volume is 37<sup>3</sup>= 50 653 cubic
			centimeters (cc). Since the liter is nearly the same as 1 000 cc, and
			the average density of sea water is 1.025 kg/L, this volume of sea
			water weighs 51.919 kg .
		</p>
		<p>
			The area of one face of a  cube is: L<sup>2</sup> = 37<sup>2</sup> =
			1 369 cm<sup>2</sup>. Since there are six faces, the surface of the
			whole cube is: 6 X 37<sup>2</sup> = 8 214 cm<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
		<p>Next, consider the surfface area of a sphere of the same
			 volume. The volume  of a sphere is:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			V<sub>s</sub> = &pi; (4 /3) r<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
		<p>(4/3 = 1 1/3 = 1.333...)</p>
		<p class="equation">
			r<sup>3</sup> = V/1.333&pi; = 50 653 cc/ 4.188790205 = 12 092.513 cc.
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			r =  <sup>3</sup>√12092.513 = 22.953 cm .
		</p>

		<p>This is the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the cube
			above (Fig. 8-2). The surface of this sphere is:</p>

		<p class="equation">
			A<sub>s</sub> = 4<span class="T13">&pi;</span> r<sup>2</sup> = 4 x
			(22.953 cm)<sup>2</sup>  =  6 620.469 cm<sup>2</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>The ratio of surface areas, sphere / cube = 6 620.469 / 8214 =
			0.8060.</p>

		<p>This means that the sphere has 19.4% less surface than the
			equal-volume cube. In fact, the sphere has the least surface of any
			solid figure of the same volume. This is good for a storage tank, but
			bad for a person who wishes to lose weight, that is, become less
			spherical. The more spherical the body, the less surface per kg. The
			result is a lower weight-specific metabolic rate, and therefore a
			slower rate of weight loss.</p>

				<b>Exercise 8-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>(a) A small bedroom is nearly cubical. The floor is 3.0 m each
				side, and the ceiling height is 2.60 m. Calculate the volume of the
				room.  (b) A spherical storage tank has a diameter of 3.002 m;
				calculate the volume.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div title="Volume of Cylinders and People">
		<p>The volume of a cylinder is the area of the base, which is
			circular, times the height. To construct a cylinder with the same
			volume as the cube and sphere above, begin by selecting a base with a
			radius of  0.100 m.</p>
		<p class="equation">
			V = &pi; r<sup>2</sup> h  = 50 653 cc =  0.050653 m<sup>3</sup>  =
			0.031415926 h,
		</p>
		<p class="equation">h  = 0.050653 / 0.031415926 = 1.612m.</p>

		<p>
			The volume here was shown to weigh 51.919 kg, if the material has the
			same density as sea water, which the human body does.  The calculated
			height of the woman-shaped column is 1.612m.  The radius of this
			cylinder results in a circumference of  0.200 &pi;, which corresponds
			to a waistline of 62.8 cm (24 ¾ in.). Her BMI = 51.919 kg/ 2.5996 m<sup>2</sup>
			= 19.97 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, at the lower end of the healthy range.
		</p>

		<p>The surface area of a cylinder is the circumference of the base
			times the height, plus the areas of the bottom and top circles. The
			woman-shaped column has suface area:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			A = 2 &pi; r h + 2 &pi; r<sup>2 </sup>= 1.01306  + 0.062831853 =
			1.075891853 m<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

		<p>Many formulas have been invented for relating weight and height
			of human subjects to body surface area (BSA). One proposed by DuBois
			in 1916 became popular for calculating the proper dose of a drug:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			S = 0.007184 x W<sup>0.425</sup>x  H<sup>0.725</sup>      
		</p>
		<p>
			This equation uses H in cm, W in kg, and yields S in m<sup>2</sup>.
			For the woman-shaped column, W = 51.919 kg and H = 161.2 cm. The
			result of calculation is:  S = 1.53458 m<sup>2</sup>. The ratios of
			volume to surface (V/S) in Table 8-1 indicate that the shape of this
			lady does not match any of these three figures of solid geometry, but
			approaches the cylindrical.

		<p>Use of the equation above produces the result that a 4.536 kg
			(10 lbs) increase in body weight, with no change in height, increases
			weight by 8.73% and surface by 3.62 %. The body has become more
			spherical;metabolic rate, since it is proportional to surface area,
			would also increase less than weight.</p>

			The classic BSA equation, still in use, over-estimates the surface of
			obese people. A recent revision changes the exponents, and gives the
			result in cm<sup>2</sup>:
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			S = 94.9 X W<sup>0.441</sup> X H<sup>0.655</sup>

				With the revised equation, re-calculate the BSA of the woman-shaped
				column. To get further practice with the y<sup>x</sup> function on
				the calculator, find BSA by both equations for John Godina, who is
				193.0 cm tall, and weighs 129.0 kg.

		<p>Like a fossil in the rocks,  the cubic foot remains stuck in
			the literature. To convert:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			1 m = 39.37 inches, 1 m<sup>3</sup> = (39.37)<sup>3</sup> = 61
			023.37795 in<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			1 ft = 12 in, 1ft<sup> 3 </sup>= (12)<sup>3</sup> =  1 728 in<sup>3</sup>
		</p>
		<p class="equation">61 023/1728  = 35.314 cubic feet = 1 cubic
			meter</p>

			<p>(1) Convert the volumes in Exercise 8-1 to cubic feet.</p>
			<p>(2)  If a cylinder has the same radius as a sphere, and a
				height of 2r, then the sphere fits inside the cylinder like a tennis
				ball in a can that holds only one ball. Use the equations above to
				find what fraction of the can volume is occupied by the ball.</p>

		<p>The last problem was solved by Archimedes, who asked that the
			sphere-in-cylinder figure be inscribed on his tombstone. Look for it,
			when you visit Syracuse.</p>
