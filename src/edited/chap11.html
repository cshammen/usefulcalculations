	<div title="Atmospheric Pressure">
		<p>Everyone is under pressure - atmospheric pressure outside, and
			blood pressure inside. Pressures of work and family life are not
			readily quantified: see your psychotherapist about them.</p>

		<p>Atmospheric pressure is due to the weight of the air, which
			varies a little from day to day, and decreases with altitude.
			Ordinarily noticed only by mariners and weather people, it is
			measured by a barometer. The simplest type of barometer is a tube of
			some liquid inverted, mouth down, in an open dish of the same liquid.
			The column falls, leaving a vacuum at the top of the tube. It remains
			high because of the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the liquid
			in the dish. The favorite liquid is mercury, a metallic element that
			has a very high density, and is in the liquid state at ordinary
			environmental temperatures.
			('&upsilon;&delta;&rho;&alpha;&rho;&gamma;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;'
			= quicksilver = mercury = Hg).</p>

		<p>
			The height of the column of mercury supported by the weight of the
			atmosphere is usually just over ¾ meter, or 760 mm (Figure 11-1).
			This apparatus is so simple that it is tempting to express all
			pressures in mm Hg, but this is a naïve, unscientific way of thinking
			about pressures.  Automobile tires are marked with maximum inflation
			pressures in psi (<i>p</i>ounds per <i>s</i>quare <i>i</i>nch) and
			kPa (kilopascals), but not in mm Hg. The relation of these units is
			worth examining. If the tire pressure is 44 psi, the first step is to
			convert one pound into kilograms:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">1lb/ 2.20462 lbs = x/ 1 kg,   x = 0.453592909
			kg</p>

		<p>Pressure is a force, and a force is the product of mass and
			acceleration:</p>
		<p class="equation">f = ma.</p>
		<p>Thank you, Sir Isaac.</p>
		<p>
			The acceleration of gravity a = 9.80665 m / s<sup>2</sup>. Therefore:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			f = 0.453592909  kg X  9.80665 m / s<sup>2</sup>
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			=  4.448226905 kg- m / s<sup>2</sup> = 4.448 Newtons
		</p>

		<p>The next step is to find the area subject to this force:</p>

		<p class="equation">
			1 inch / 39.37 in/m = 0.0254 m, 1 in<sup>2</sup> = (0.0254 m)<sup>2</sup>
			= 0.000645162 m<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			4.448 N / 0.000645162 m<sup>2</sup> = 6894.744119 N/ m<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

		<p>The unit of force with these SI dimensions is called the
			Pascal, after a Frenchman who studied the meaning of pressure, among
			other things. This unit is too small for most measuring devices, so
			the usual practice is to deal with the unit 1 000 times larger, the
			kiloPascal (kPa). The result above can be expressed as 1 psi = 6.8947
			kPa. Thus 44 psi = 303.3668 kPa. On the tire, this is rounded off to
			300 kPa.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 11-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>(a) Atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg or 14.696 psi. Convert
				psi to kPa.</p>
			<p>
				(b) Use 760 mm,  density of mercury = 13.595 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and
				the acceleration of gravity above, and calculate 1 atmosphere in
				kPa. (This is rather challenging because of the mixture of units,
				but give it a try.)
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>The answer to both calculations should be the same:</p>

		<p class="equation">1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 14.695 psi = 101.32 kPa.</p>

		<p>Tire inflation pressures and blood pressures are actually the
			amounts that they exceed atmospheric pressure.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 11-2.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Typical blood pressures are still given as 120 systolic and 80
				diastolic. To agree with modern practice, convert these mm Hg into
				kPa.</p>
		</div>

	<div title="Pressure of Gasses">

		<p>Breathing is accomplished by changing pressure on the air in
			the lungs, causing inhaling and exhaling. Gases expand and contract
			when pressure is varied. This is evident in hot-air balloons, tanks
			of compressed gases, and compression in the cylinders of gasoline and
			diesel engines.  The behavior of gases in response to changes in
			pressure and temperature is described by a beautiful equation:</p>

		<p class="equation">pV = nRT.</p>

		<p>
			n is number of moles;  to simplify calculation, n is taken as 1 mole,
			and p is counted in atmospheres rather than kPa. V is volume, T is
			temperature in degrees Kelvin, and R is the ideal gas constant =
			0.0821026 L-atm / mol-deg.  Standard  conditions are 1 atm and 273<sup>o</sup>K
			= 0<sup>o</sup> C. Therefore the volume of 1 mole of any gas is:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">V = RT / p = 0.0821026  X 273  = 22.414 L.</p>

		<p>
			One mole of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) weighs 28 grams, O<sub>2</sub> -
			32 g, CO<sub>2</sub> - 44 g , H<sub>2</sub> only 2 g. All occupy the
			same space. In trying to picture this volume, think of a cube 28.2 cm
			on each edge: 28.2<sup>3 </sup>= 22 426 cm<sup>3</sup>, about the
			size of a bread- box, or the box containing the chips and circuits of
			a computer, measuring
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			32 X 39 X 18 = 22 464 cm<sup>3</sup>.
		</p>

		<p>Equations for distance - time - speed, and voltage across a
			resistance, like the ideal gas equation, have the simple form y = a
			x. As Cromer wrote, “None of the linear relations of elementary
			physics is exactly true.”  At very high pressures, the volume
			decrease is less than predicted by V = RT / p.</p>
		<p>
			In order to make the equation match the data of experiments, a <i>parameter</i>
			is introduced:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">p (V - b) = nRT.</p>

		<p>For example, 1 mole of hydrogen under 500 atm  proved to have
			volume  0.060524 L. The expected volume was: 22.414 L / 500 atm  =
			0.044828 L.</p>
		<p>The difference observed sets the value of the parameter b.</p>

		<p class="equation">b = Vobs – Vexp =  0.060524 – 0.044828 =
			0.015696 L</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 11-3.</b>
			</p>
			<p>A mad physicist found that his machine could produce a
				pressure of 1000 atm on a gas. When he subjected 1 mole of  hydrogen
				to this pressure, its volume was reduced to 0.038255 L. Calculate b.</p>
		</div>

		<p>This parameter represents volume occupied by the molecules
			themselves, called the volume of exclusion or incompressible volume.
			Deviations from “ideal gas” behavior also occur due to attraction
			between gas molecules, which tends to make volumes a little less than
			expected, and requires an additional parameter. As a talk-show host
			said, “Anyone who uses the word parameter in ordinary conversation
			should not be invited to a dinner party.”</p>
