<title>Chapter 12. Gene frequency.</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div title="Gene Frequency">
		<p>The best-studied human genes are those that produce medical
			problems, such as hemolytic anemia in newborn. The Rhesus system is a
			set of antigens on red blood cells, of which the D agglutinogen is
			the strongest. It causes trouble when the mother is Rh-negative, and
			the fetus has inherited the D factor from the father. The immune
			system of the mother identifies the fetus as foreign, and produces
			antibodies that cause destruction of the fetal red cells. People may
			marry without inquiring into each other's blood types.</p>

		<p>The symbol DD represents the genotype of someone who has
			received the D gene from both parents; the symbol dd indicates the
			genotype of a person lacking the antigen, known as Rh-negative (Rh-);
			the symbol Dd stands for the heterozygous or hybrid individual. In
			the blood donation center, DD and Dd people are lumped together as
			positives (Rh+). In the US, Rh+ people make up 85 percent of the
			population, and Rh- the other 15 percent.</p>

		<p>The frequency of the genes D and d in a population can be
			calculated from the phenotypic numbers by means of the Hardy-Weinberg
			rule. This principle was discovered independently by G. H. Hardy, a
			mathematician, and S. Weinberg, a physician. Call the frequency of
			the dominant gene p, and the frequency of the recessive allele q.
			Then, by random mating, the frequencies of the genotypes are:</p>

		<p>
			(p + q)<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

		<p>
			This is called the expansion of a binomial. You learned this in
			Algebra 1. In the case of the Rh factor, q<sup>2</sup> is the same as
			the fraction of Rh- people, stated above as 0.15. The gene
			frequencies are calculated as follows:
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			q<sup>2</sup> = 0.15       q = √0.15  = 0.387298334
		</p>

		<p class="equation">p = 1 - q = 0.612701665</p>

		<p>This result allows calculation of the fractions of the two Rh+
			genotypes.</p>

		<p class="equation">
			DD = p<sup>2</sup> = ( 0.6127)<sup>2</sup> = 0.3754
		</p>

		<p class="equation">Dd = 2 pq = 2 X 0.6127 X 0.3873 = 0.4746</p>

		<p>Adding the dd fraction 0.15 makes the total 1.0, or 100
			percent, as expected.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 12-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>In some Asian populations, the fraction of dd individuals has
				been reported as only 1 percent. Assuming exactly 0.010, calculate
				the gene frequencies p and q.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Gene frequencies may change as a result of mutation or
			selection or migration. As W. F. Ganong wrote, “In general, harmful
			mutations tend to die out, but mutant genes that confer traits with
			survival value persist and spread in the population.”  In effect, he
			stated the essence of human evolution.</p>

		<p>The gene for sickle-cell anemia produces a modified hemoglobin
			molecule, which causes red blood cells to assume an abnormal sickle
			or crescent shape at low oxygen concentrations (Fig. 12-1). People
			with genotype ss are severely affected, those with Ss have few
			symptoms, and those with the dominant genotype SS are normal.  In
			some populations of equatorial Africa, sickle-cell anemia patients
			(ss) amount to 1 in 64 or more (0.015625), and people with the trait
			(Ss) up to 40%. Call the frequency of S, the normal allele, a, and
			call the frequency of s, the harmful mutant gene, b.  Applying the
			Hardy-Weinberg rule:</p>

		<p class="equation">
			b<sup>2</sup> = 0.01562,   b = √0.01562 = 0.12498,    a = 1 - b =
			0.8750
		</p>

		<p>These frequencies can be used to calculate the fractions of
			each class:</p>

		<p> Phenotype         Genotype          Frequency         Observed
			        Expected</p>

		<p>
			normal             SS                       a<sup>2</sup>            
			         0.58                0.765625
		</p>
		<p>carrier              Ss                      2ab              
			      0.40                0.218715</p>
		<p>
			afflicted           ss                        b<sup>2</sup>          
			            0.01562
		</p>
		<p>                                 </p>
		<p>This result suggests that the observed fraction of carriers
			(Ss) is too high, and normal (SS) too low. Something is disturbing
			the genetic equilibrium.</p>

		<p>Exercise 12-2. Calculate the expected gene frequencies in the
			African-American population, with the disease 1 in 500,  and the
			trait 1 in 12, using the reasoning and steps above.</p>

		<p>  In this case, the observed and expected are not far apart.
			What is different in Africa and America?  Many things, but the
			explanation seems to lie in the prevalence of malaria.  The abnormal
			hemoglobin hampers the rapid growth of the malarial parasite in the
			bloodstream, conferring a selective advantage on those with the
			sickle-cell trait, when they live in a region where malaria</p>
		<p>is prevalent. Such regions are common in central Africa,
			uncommon in USA.</p>

		<p>A successful blood transfusion requires matching ABO blood
			types of donor and recipient. Everyone has one of the four types, A,
			B, O, or AB, genetically determined, and unaltered through life. In
			an incompatible transfusion, the donor is not harmed, but his red
			cells encounter antibody in the recipient's bloodstream, which causes
			them to agglutinate and block capillary circulation. Inheritance
			gives each person two out of the set of three genes, two of which, A
			and B, are co-dominant. The genes are designated</p>
		<p>
			I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and i, for their role in producing
			isoagglutinogens.

		<p>
			<sup>   </sup> If the gene frequencies are symbolized by p, q, and r,
			and the Hardy-Weinberg rule applies, then the fractions of the
			genotypes in a population should correspond to the expansion of a
			trinomial:
		</p>

		<p>
			                          (p + q + r)<sup>2</sup> = p<span class="T2">2</span>
			+ 2 pq + q<sup>2</sup> + 2 pr + 2 qr + r<sup>2</sup>
		</p>

		<p class="P2">            r2 = (frequency of ii) = fraction of
			type O in population = 45% in USA</p>

		<p>
			                                r<sup>2</sup> = 0.45    r = √0.45 =
			0.670820393
		</p>

		<p>
			Type A corresponds to the terms of the expansion p<sup>2</sup> + 2
			pr, and occurs in about 41% of people in the US. But we already have
			r, and we recognize, because of our familiarity with basic algebra,
			that p can be found, since:
		</p>

		<p>
			   (p + r)<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup> + 2pr + r<sup>2</sup><span
				class="T1"> = 0.41 +  0.45 = 0.86 = total of type A and type
				O.</span>
		</p>

		<p>    p + r = √0.86 = 0.927361849        p = 0.92736  - 0.67082 =
			0.25654</p>

		<p>Since the sum must equal 1:   q = 1 - (p + r) = 1 - 0.92736 =
			0.07263815</p>
		<p class="P1" />
		<p>With the frequencies p, q, and r known, the expected fractions
			of types B and AB can be calculated, and compared with the reported
			fractions.</p>

		<p>
			Type B:     q<sup>2</sup> + 2 qr = (0.07263815)<span class="T2">2</span>
			+ 2 X 0.072638 X 0.67082 = 0.10273
		</p>

		<p>Type AB:    2pq = 2 X 0.25654 X 0.072638 = 0.03727</p>

		<p>These results agree with the 10% and 4% listed above, and
			indicate a genetic equilibrium, sometimes called a balanced
			polymorphism. The fraction of people who are both AB and Rh-negative
			is:</p>
		<p>0.03727 X 0.15 = 0.0055905, or about 56 in 10 000.</p>

		<p>Exercise 12-3.  The percentages of blood types in Japan are: O
			= 30, A = 38, B = 22, and AB = 10. Find the gene frequencies by the
			procedure shown here, and determine whether the fractions B and AB
			are consistent with the data.                </p>

		<p>Young couples in Japan have been reported to compare blood
			types when they first meet. Do not laugh; some of our own young
			people consider signs of the zodiac when choosing a potential mate.</p>
