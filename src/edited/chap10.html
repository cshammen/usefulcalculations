<title>Chapter 10. Exponential Decay</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div title="Radioactive decay">
		<p>Some natural processes show an exponential decrease, rather
			than an increase. An important type of exponential decrease is shown
			by the decay rate of radioactive materials.</p>

		<p>Element number 84, the first radioactive element, was
			discovered by Marie Curie, a Polish chemist working in Paris. She
			named it Polonium. All of the elements from 84 to 92 are radioactive,
			which means that they are unstable, and break down spontaneously,
			emitting particles and rays. The atoms disintegrate on a predictable
			schedule, not according to the age of individual atoms, but according
			to the total present at any moment. The decay process is a
			statistical process, which can be described by equations like the
			population growth equations, but with a negative rate constant.</p>

		<p>The first radioactive element isolated was radium, separated
			from uranium ore by Marie (Fig. 10-1) and Pierre Curie in 1898.
			(Pierre taught her French, and she taught him Polish.) The decay
			process is symbolized by:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			 <sub>88</sub>Ra<sup>226</sup> -----&gt; <sub>86</sub>Rn<sup>222</sup> +
			&alpha;
		</p>
		<p> The products are a radon atom and an alpha particle, which
			consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, thus accounting for both the
			decrease of 2 in atomic number and the decrease of 4 in atomic
			weight.The rate of decay is:</p>
		<p class="equation">dN/dt = &lambda;N</p>
		<p>N is number of atoms; &lambda; is a rate constant that is
			negative.</p>
		<p>The same rearrangement and integration used in Chapter 7
			yields:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			&lambda; = (ln N<sub>t</sub>- ln N<sub>0</sub>) / &delta;t
		</p>
		<p>The decay constant can be calculated from the weight of the
			Curie sample, which was originally 200.0 mg, and 100 years later
			weighed 191.62 mg.</p>
		<p class="equation">
			= (ln 191.62 - ln 200.0) / 100y = - 0.042803122 / 100y =
			-0.00042803122/y =  - 4.28 X 10<sup>-4</sup>/y
		</p>

		<p>The decay constant is an important factor in the use of
			radioactivity in  tracer experiments, radiation therapy, and dating
			of ancient artifacts. Another  useful constant is called the
			half-life, which applies to a chemist who needs to get a life. No,
			not really. It is the time to lose one-half of the original
			radioactivity, and is related to the decay constant. For the radium
			sample, the calculation is:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			t<sub>1/2</sub> = ln 0.5/ &lambda; =  - 0.69314718 / - 4.28 X 10<sup>-4</sup> =
			1620 years
		</p>

		<p>
			All of the atoms of a single element are not identical. They all have
			the same number of protons and electrons, and therefore the same
			atomic number, and the same chemistry. However, variation in the
			number of neutrons results in different kinds of atoms of the same
			element, called isotopes. For example, most carbon atoms are C-12,
			but there are three other isotopes. The abundances are <sup>12</sup>
			= 98.9%, the heavy isotope C<sup>13</sup> = 1.1 %, and very small
			 quantities of C<sup>11</sup> and C<sup>14</sup>, both radioisotopes.
		</p>

		<p>C-11 has been produced from boron by bombardment with deuterons
			in a cyclotron. The reaction is symbolized by:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			<sub>5</sub>B<sup>10</sup> (d,n) <sub>6</sub>C<sup>11</sup>
		</p>
		<p>
			C<sup>11</sup> decays back to boron, and the emitted positron can be
			detected by the appropriate radiation counter. Until the atoms
			disintegrate, they behave chemically just like ordinary C-12 carbon.
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			C<sup>11</sup> -----&gt;  B<sup>11</sup> + &beta;<sup>+</sup>
		</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 10-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The decay constant of C<sup>11</sup> is &lambda;= - 0.0340/ min.
				Calculate the half-life.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			This result indicates that experiments with C<sup>11</sup> must be
			completed quickly, or the radioactivity will decay to the point where
			there is too little to<span class="T2"> m</span>easure. The general
			rule is a limit of 8 times the half-life, in this case only 2 hours
			43 minutes. On the other hand, C<sup>14</sup>
		</p>

		<p>
			Small amounts of C<sup>14</sup> are continuously produced in the
			atmosphere by cosmic-ray bombardment of nitrogen. C-14 is produced in
			the laboratory by irradiation of N-14 with neutrons in a nuclear
			reactor, by the same n,p reaction.
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			<sub>7</sub>N <sup>14</sup> (n,p) <sub>6</sub>C<span class="super">14</span>
		</p>

		<p>(The subscript numbers 7 and 6 are superfluous, because every
			chemist knows that nitrogen is element 7 and carbon is element
			6.) The decay is by emission of beta particles, which are fast-moving
			electrons:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			C<sup>14</sup>-----&gt; N<sup>14</sup>+ &beta;<sup>-</sup>
		</p>

		<p>Carbon-14 has been extremely useful in tracing pathways of
			metabolism, especially in photosynthesis studies, and in some aspects
			of medical research.</p>

		<p>
			Important to archeologists was the use of C-14 by Willard F. Libby to
			determine the age of prehistoric artifacts. This radioactive isotope
			is present at very low concentration in the CO<sub>2</sub> of the
			air. Carbon dioxide is used by plants to make sugars, starches, and
			cellulose. C-14 enters the bodies of animals that eat plants. When
			living things die, they are removed from the carbon cycle, the C<sup>14</sup>
			is no longer replenished, and it continues to decay. Thus, the
			samples of ancient wood, charcoal, and bone have less radioactivity
			than modern materials. Special apparatus, consisting of very
			sensitive detectors and heavy shielding, were built to record these
			extremely low levels of radiation.
		</p>

		<div class="exercise">

			<p>Given the half-life of C-14 as 5730 years, calculate the decay

	<div title="Radioactive dating">
		<p>The decay constant &lambda; can be used in the same way as the
			growth constant r in the population-growth equation, to calculate age
			of the sample counted:</p>

		<p>The basic equation describing the process is:</p>

		<p class="equation">
			&Delta;t = (ln Nt - ln  N<sub>0</sub>) / &lambda;
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, a sample of charcoal taken in 2000 from the late
			Neolithic Stonehenge site (Fig. 10-2) had C<sup>14</sup>
			radioactivity = 7.96 counts per minute (c/m) per gram carbon. Modern
			samples of material from living organisms average 13.56 c/m per g C.
		</p>

		<p class="equation">&Delta;t = (ln 7.96 - ln 13.56) / -
			0.000120968/ y = -0.532695282/ - 0.000120968/y</p>
		<p class="equation">= 4 403.6 years before present</p>
		<p>This makes the age of the Stonehenge site:</p>
		<p class="equation">2000 - 4 404 = 2404 BC.</p>

		<p>The Lascaux cave in the Dordogne region of France has many
			paintings made by a Paleolithic artist, including the long-extinct
			bison (Fig. 10-3).</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 10-3.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Using the modern radioactivity figure above, find the age of a
				sample of bone from the Lascaux cave that had 2.075 c/m per g C.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Civilization had developed in Mesopotamia and Egypt long before
			Stonehenge, but some of the artifacts are less ancient. The funerary
			boat of Sesostris III (Fig. 10-3) was found in his burial chamber
			inside the pyramid near Dahshur, Egypt. A piece of wood, probably
			cedar, from the boat was obtained from the Chicago Natural History
			Museum by Dr. Lilly in 1949, and was analyzed for C-14 age.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 10-4.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Assuming 13.56 dpm/g C for modern wood, and 8.56 for the
				 sample, calculate age of the boat.</p>

		<p>Willard F. Libby received a Nobel prize in 1960, published a
			book on radiocarbon dating in 1965, and died in 1980.</p>

		<p>
			The C-14 method cannot be used for dating fossils, remains of
			organisms that lived millions of years ago. Some of these have been
			dated by the K<sup>40</sup> method. Many minerals contain potassium,
			and are found in the sedimentary rocks in which fossils are embedded.
			K<sup>40</sup> has two decay products, Ca<sup>40</sup> and Ar<sup>40</sup>
			, so the analysis is complicated, requiring assumptions about the
			original quantity of K. Data from mass spectrometer analysis of a
			sample of mica from the Cambrian indicates N<sub>0</sub> = 0.0741mg
			of K<sup>40</sup>, and present Nt = 0.0541mg. The decay constant is:
			&lambda; = 5.501 X 10<sup>-10</sup> / y.
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			&Delta;t = (ln 0.0541 - ln 0.0741) /  5.501 X 10<sup>-10</sup>/ y =
			0.0571862 X 10<sup>10</sup> y
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			= 570  X 10<sup>6</sup> = 570 million years
		</p>

		<p>Geologists agree that this is the correct age for the Cambrian,
			the earliest period with abundant animal fossils. About half of the
			known Cambrian fossils are trilobites, beautiful marine animals that
			became totally extinct in the Permian period.</p>
