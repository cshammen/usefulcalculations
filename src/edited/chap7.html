<title>Chapter 7. Population Growth</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div title="Population Growth and Generations">
		<p>
			Populations of many simpler organisms, like bacteria or amoebas,
			 grow by doubling each generation, under good conditions. The numbers
			of cells or individuals ( y ) depend on the number of generations ( x
			), according to the equation y = 2<sup>x</sup>. It is useful to draw
			a graph of this, with x from 0 to 10, to show how a very small
			initial population can produce over 1 000 descendants (2<sup>1
			</sup>=2; 2<sup>10</sup> = 1&nbsp;024). Of course, the time scale varies
			greatly with animal species, because generation time varies. The
			number of offspring per generation may be much more than 2 in some
			species. For example, a pair of fruitflies can produce 200 little
			flies in 2 weeks; thus populations of <span class="italic">Drosophila</span>
			do not really double; they explode.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Darwin (1859) pointed out, Linnaeus had calculated that an annual
			plant that produces only two seeds that develop into seedlings each
			year can have over one million offspring after 20 years. (2<sup>20</sup>
			= 1 048 576).         
		</p>
		<p>
			The doubling principle works in reverse when considering ancestors :
			2<sup>1</sup> parents, 2<sup>2</sup>  grandparents, 2<sup>3</sup>
			 great-grandparents etc. With an average generation time of 30 years,
			about 12 generations have passed since the 17<sup>th</sup> century
			(1640 + 360 = 2000). Thus each person now living has 2<sup>12</sup>
			ancestors from that era. Estimates of world population (Table 7-2)
			make it clear that the number of people living then was far too small
			to allow each modern individual to have an unique set of 4 096
			ancestors. Therefore, it is highly probable that any two people from
			the same part of the world, say Norway or Mongolia, have one or more
			ancestors in common.
		</p>

			<p>
				<b>Exercise 7-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Draw graphs of y = 2<sup>x</sup> and y = log 2<sup>x</sup>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			A good graph has scales on both the vertical (y) and horizontal (x)
			axes, shows all the points, and is clearly labelled. The log plot is
			linear, because<span class="italic">a logarithm is an
				exponent.</span> Remember the firm rule that: when quantities with the same
			base are multiplied, the exponents are added.
		</p>
		<p>The number of living individuals is affected by survivorship,
			that is, the overlapping of generations. Future population sizes can
			be estimated by subtracting death rate from birth rate. For example,
			in Florida in 1999, the birth rate was 13.0 live births per 1000
			population, and the death rate was 10.8 per 1000. If the total
			population was 15 982 378, then the net increase would be (13.0 -
			10.8)/ 1000 = + 0.0022 per year.</p>
		<p>This predicts an increase of:</p>
		<p>0.0022 X 15 982 378 = 35 161 people added by the following
			year.</p>
	</div>
	<div title="Growth Rate">
		<p>Population growth rates can be expressed as the ratio of
			present census to an earlier one. For example, the population of
			Sarasota County, FL was 277 776 in 1990, and 325 957 in 2000. The
			growth rate was:  325 957 / 277 776 = 1.17348871; 1.17348871 – 1 =
			+17.35% in 10 years = 1.735%/yr.</p>
		<p>In the same years, the population of Newark, NJ changed from
			275 221 to 273 546. The rate was negative:</p>
		<p class="equation">0.993913981 -1 = -0.006086019 in 10 years =
			-0.0609%/yr.</p>

		<p>Perhaps 1 675 people moved from Newark to Sarasota in that
			decade. (If so, they made a good decision.) These population changes
			may be compared to the increase in the entire USA. The first census
			was done in 1790. and it was repeated every ten years since then
			(Table 7-1).</p>

				<b>Exercise 7-2.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Calculate the percentage change of USA population from 1990 to
				2000.</p>
		</div>

		<p>This result suggests that Sarasota population grew more rapidly
			than the average for the whole country.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 7-3.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Make a graph of USA population (y)<span class="italic"> vs </span>years
				(x) from 1790 to 1890: then make a graph of log y. Your graphs
				should resemble Fig. 7-1.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			These graphs look much like the graphs of y = 2<sup>x</sup> (Exercise
			7-1), and suggest doubling, or some other exponential process, like
			money at compound interest. Thanks to calculus, it is possible to
			derive an equation, similar to the compound-interest equation, which
			allows calculation of annual growth rates, and projections of future
			populations.  
		</p>

		<p>The basic equation is: dN/dt = rN, where N is number, t is
			time, and r is a rate constant. As Banks (1998) wrote, “the rate at
			which a particular quantity grows is directly proportional to the
			amount of the quantity present at any moment.”</p>

		<p> The problem is to obtain r from counts taken at two times. In
			ecology, r is a natural rate of increase, a characteristic of a
			species when its population growth is unrestrained.  To obtain r from
			census data, the basic equation must be transformed into one that
			allows calculation. By a theorem of calculus, the process of
			integration yields :</p>

		<p class="equation">
			N<sub>t</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> = e<sup>rt</sup>
		</p>

		<p>
			N<sub>o</sub> is the initial number; N<sub>t</sub> is the number at
			time t;  e is a constant, the base of the system of natural
			logarithms is symbolized ln rather than log. The logarithmic form of
			the equation above is:          
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			r = (ln N<sub>t</sub> - ln N<sub>0</sub>) / ∆t
		</p>

		<p>Remember that log refers to logarithms of  the base 10. A
			LOGARITHM IS AN EXPONENT.  e is an irrational number, approximately
			2.718. Your scientific calculator will give you a more precise value
			of e. Because the base is smaller, the ln of a number is about 2.3
			times the log of the number.</p>

		<p>Now, let us find r for a particular population. In 1995, the
			population of Pakistan was 131.5 million, and in the year 2000, it
			was 144.6 million.</p>

		<p class="equation">r = (ln 144.6 - ln 131.5)/ 5 y = (4.97397131 –
			4.879006852)/ 5</p>
		<p class="equation">= 0.094964458/5 = 0.01899/y = 1.899 % per year</p>

		<p>Note the similarity to a calculation of rate of appreciation of
			property (Chapter 6). The main difference is the use of  base e,
			rather than base 10 logarithm. The compound-interest equation seems a
			variant of this more fundamental equation.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 7-4.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Calculate r of USA for two 50-year periods, 1790-1840, and
				1950-2000, from the two pairs of census data (Table 7-1).</p>
		</div>

		<p>This result shows a much more rapid population growth in the
			early history of the country. Was it due to immigration, or a very
			high birth rate, or both?</p>

		<p>In ecology, r is often a maximum rate, observed when population
			growth is unrestrained by environmental factors. For humans, this is
			about 3.0% per year.</p>

		<p>Future populations can be predicted by using the most recent r
			value, according to a different form of the same equation:</p>

		<p class="equation">
			ln P<sub>t</sub> = ln P<sub>0</sub> + r∆t
		</p>

		<p>To predict the population of Pakistan in 2005:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			ln P<sub>t</sub> = ln 144.6 + 0.01884 X 5 y = 5.06817131
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the e<sup>x</sup> function to find P<sub>t</sub>= 158.9 million.

		<p>This predicts a year 2020 population very much greater than the
			year 2000, and  raises the question of saturation level or carrying
			capacity of the earth. One view is that the more people the better;
			advances in agriculture and engineering can always supply more food
			and water. The only real problem is distribution. Another view is
			that a finite earth cannot support an unlimited number of people, and
			the earth is already dangerously overpopulated. Thus, ways to limit
			population growth must be found. Which is correct?</p>
