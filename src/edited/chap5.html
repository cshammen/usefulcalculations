<div title="Radius, Circumference, and Pi">
<p>The radius (r) of a circle is the distance set on your compass
when you draw a circle, and the distance from the center to the boundary
of any circular object. The distance around, or perimeter, is called the
circumference (C), and the straight-line distance across the circle,
through the center, is called the diameter. The diameter (d) is exactly
twice the radius. There is a fixed ratio between the circumference (C)
and the diameter (d), expressed algebraically as <sup>C</sup>&frasl;<sub>d</sub>.
What, exactly, is the value of this ratio?</p>

<div class="imagediv">Fig. 5-1<br />
<img title="Fig. 5-1" src="images/square-circle.png" /></div>

<p>The number must be less than 4, because the perimeter of a square
that encloses a circle is 4d. See Figure 5-1. The number must be greater
than 3, because when 6 radii are marked off on the circumference, the
straight-line figure inside is a regular hexagon, with perimeter 3d.</p>

<p>Archimedes of Syracuse (Sicily, not New York) was curious about
the precise ratio between C and d. Around 250 BC, he had no calculator
and not even a good number system, but by constructing polygons with
more-and-more sides, and dividing them into triangles, he found a good
approximation of the number, which about 1700 AD came to be called pi
(&pi;) the 16th letter of the Greek alphabet.</p>

<p class="equation"><sup>C</sup>&frasl;<sub>d</sub> = &pi;, C = &pi;d = 2&pi;r</p>

<p class="equation">3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> = <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>
&gt; &pi; &gt; 3 <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub> = <sup>223</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub></p>

<p>The ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle (&pi;) is
given here as approximately 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>, which is
the same as <sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. It is possible to have
fractions between any two whole numbers, not just between 0 and 1. In
principle, the interval between 3 and 4 could be divided in 71 equal
pieces, and we could take 10 of them to make the desired ratio. Thus
&pi; is also about 3<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>71</sub>.</p>

<p>Although fractions can be precise, and operations with fractions
have simple, well-defined rules, it is often more practical to do
calculations with their decimal equivalents: <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
= 0.25, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> = 0.125, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>
= 0.0625 etc. The decimal equivalent of a fraction is the upper number
(numerator) divided by the lower one (denominator).</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p><b>Exercise 5-1.</b> Find the decimal equivalents of the
Archimedes fractions.</p>
</div>

<p>An average of these two values is very close to the desired
ratio. A closer ratio, <sup>355</sup>&frasl;<sub>113</sub>, was known to
ancient Chinese astronomers. The value in a scientific calculator is
3.141592654. By playing with numbers, one can find fractions even
closer, such as <sup>12 546 274</sup>&frasl;<sub>3 993 603.</sub></p>

<p>The value of &pi; can be calculated ever more closely by adding
various series of ever-smaller fractions (discovered by Leibniz and
Euler), a tedious procedure ideally suited to computers. Some people
have become so obsessed with &pi; that they carry calculations to
ridiculous extremes. That is why &pi; is called an irrational number.
No, not really; it is because there is no ratio of whole numbers that
expresses it exactly.</p>

<p><b>Exercise 5-2.</b></p>
<p>1 . A circular pool area has a radius of 2.40 m. What length of
fencing material is needed to enclose it?</p>
<p>2 . The distance around the near-circular Crater Lake, Oregon, is
26.043 km; calculate the distance across it.</p>

<p>The area of a circular space, such as a ring at a three-ring
circus, or the surface of Crater Lake, should be some multiple of its
linear dimension squared. Perhaps the area of a circle is some multiple
of r<sup>2</sup>. Eureka!</p>

<p class="equation">A = &pi;r<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The childish geometrical joke is: “Pie r not square, pie are
round.” In most languages, however, i has the sound of i in machine.
With an international group, the joker should say, “pea are round.”</p>

<p>Hagia Sophia in Istanbul (Fig. 5-3) was first built as a church
by Constantius in 360AD, was burned and rebuilt twice, became a mosque,
and is now a museum.</p>

<p><b>Exercise 5-4.</b> The average diameter of the dome of Hagia
Sophia is 31.376m. Calculate the area and the circumference of the
circular floor directly beneath the dome.</p>

<p>A sphere is the solid figure generated by rotating a circle, and
there are many interesting sphere-like objects, such as Earth, for
example. Geometry of the sphere was investigated by Archimedes, and of
course the constant &pi; appears in the equations for volume and surface
of the sphere. See C. 8.</p>
