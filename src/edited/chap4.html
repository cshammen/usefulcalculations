<p>Chapter 4. Plain Geometry</p>
<div title="Pythagorean Theorem">
<p>In a world of opinion, conjecture, guesswork, and lies, the only
certainties are death and taxes. No, there is one other certain thing:
the Pythagorean theorem. It specifies the lengths of the sides of a
right triangle. The square on the hypotenuse is exactly equal to the sum
of the squares on the other two sides. The hypotenuse, from
&upsilon;&pi;&omicron;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&omega;, meaning to prop
up, is the slanted side opposite the right angle. The perfect right
angle is found only in geometry, but anything standing upright, like the
wall of a building, or a tree trunk, or a soldier at attention, forms an
approximate right angle with the base. In any spatial arrangement that
looks like a right triangle, the theorem gives us the ability to
calculate a length or distance that may be difficult or impossible to
measure.</p>

<p>Suppose that a triangular area has sides that are 5 and 12 meters
long; what is the length of the third side, the hypotenuse? In the
notation of algebra:</p>

<p>x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>= z<sup>2</sup><br />
<br />
5<sup>2</sup>+ 12<sup>2</sup>= 25 + 144 = 169 = z<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Realize that z, the length of the hypotenuse, is <i>not</i> 169;
z is the <i>square root</i> of 169, symbolized <math>
<msqrt>
169
</msqrt>
</math></p>

<p>Use of the square root command on the calculator gives <math>
<msqrt>
169
</msqrt>
</math> = 13.</p>

<p>Thus, the length is z = 13 m. The x<sup>2</sup> button verifies
this: 13<sup>2</sup> = 169.</p>

<p>The square root sign is your friend. It asks: What number, when
multiplied by itself, will produce the designated number?</p>

<p>Sometimes the hypotenuse is known, and its length is used to
calculate the length of one of the other sides. If the triangular area
has a side of 15 m and hypotenuse of 17 m:</p>

<p>15<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 17<sup>2</sup><br />
<br />
y<sup>2</sup>= 289 - 225 = 64<br />
<br />
y = <math>
<msqrt>
64
</msqrt>
</math> = 8 m</p>

<p>An antenna 10.1 meters tall needs a guy wire to brace it. If the
wire is anchored 5.50 m from the base, and extends to the top, what
length of wire is needed? Call the height of the antenna a, and the
distance on the ground b; then the wire is the hypotenuse c, and the
Pythagorean relation is:</p>

<p>c<sup>2</sup>= a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>c<sup> 2</sup> = 10.1<sup>2</sup> + 5.50<sup>2</sup>= 132.26 m<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>c = <math>
<msqrt>
132.26
</msqrt>
</math> = 11.50 m, the length of the guy wire.</p>

<div title="Calculating Area">

<p>When a home space needs to be painted, papered, carpeted, or
tiled, the problem is to calculate area. If the space resembles a square
with a side of length ( L) = 2.45 m, the answer is : L<sup>2</sup> =
2.45<sup>2</sup>= 6.00 m<sup>2</sup>. If the space is rectangular, the
length and width are multiplied together:</p>
<p>L X W = 2.45m X 3.35m = 8.21 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>The floor area of a house or an apartment is often an important
factor in determining its value, and the correct amount of homeowners
insurance . If the rooms are not rectangular, the calculation of total
area can be tricky. A good strategy is to make a sketch showing
dimensions, then divide the spaces into rectangles and triangles . The
areas of each of the parts can be calculated separately, then added. The
area of a triangle (A ) = bh/2 (1/2 the product of base and height).</p>

<p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Fig. 4-2) was built to a height of
54.50 m. Because of the tilt, an object dropped from the top now lands
5.034 m from the base. Take the original height as the hypotenuse, and
the present vertical height as side a. How far does the object fall ?</p>

<p>a<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>= 54.50<sup>2</sup>
- 5.034<sup>2 </sup>= 2 944.908844</p>

<p>a = <math>

<p>Galileo dropped two balls, one wood and one iron, from the top,
and found that they hit the ground at the same time (Fig. 4-2). Given
the value of a above, how long did it take for the balls to drop? The
modern value for the acceleration of gravity is 9.80 m/s<sup>2.</sup> <b>(54.267m/
9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 5.53775 s<sup>2</sup> )</b> Calculation gives 2.35
seconds.</p>

<p>Any elevation above sea level makes it possible to see farther
out to sea.. The seaman in the crow's-nest observes a more distant
horizon. In Figure 4-3, r = the radius of the earth, x = the elevation
of the observer, and y = distance to the horizon.</p>

<p>A person standing on the beach has eye level x = 1.524 m. An
average radius of the earth is 6 371.406 km . From the Pythagorean
theorem :</p>

<p>r<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = ( r+x ) <sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Note that x must be expressed in km before adding it to r, and
that the addition must be done before r+x is squared.</p>

<p>y<sup>2 </sup>= (6 371.407524)<sup>2</sup> - (6 371.406)<sup>2
</sup>= 19.4189</p>

<p>y = <math>
<msqrt>
19.4189
</msqrt>
</math> = 4.4067 km (2.738 miles)</p>


<p>This is the distance to the horizon for a person standing on the
beach. Marilyn Vos Savant <!-- (Fig. 4-4) [no image available]-->
answered this question in her column of June 15, 2003, and she was
right, as usual.</p>

<p>Mike and Jennifer are stuck on top of the Wonder Wheel at Coney
Island.</p>
<p>Mike: I think we can see about five times farther than anyone on
the beach.</p>
<p>Jennifer: Let's work it out. I always keep my calculator in my
backpack.</p>
