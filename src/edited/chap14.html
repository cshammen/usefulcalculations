	<div title="Summary">
		<p>The topics chosen for this book have sampled arithmetic,
			geometry, algebra, and a bit of calculus. The goal was to provide a
			kind of “liberal arts” experience for students who might be inclined
			to seek ways of avoiding mathematics. The liberal arts are those
			“befitting a free man”. In the modern sense, they consist of the
			humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. In the classical
			sense, the liberal arts were exactly seven: a trivium (grammar,
			rhetoric, and logic), and a quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry,
			astronomy, and music). The number of departments in a college or
			university corresponds to the number of ways in which knowledge can
			be divided. Not to hurt anyone's feelings, some subjects are basic,
			and some are not. Mathematics is certainly one of the basics. A
			technician is someone who knows his job, and a bit more.  A
			philosopher is someone who knows everything, and nothing more. A
			mathematician is someone who makes new mathematics. A scientist is
			someone who wants to see the data, and wants to know what conclusions
			are implied by the data. A liberal artist is someone who likes
			discussion, and believes that he or she can be successful at
			virtually any task.</p>
		<p>Several chapters have shown how much physics and chemistry
			depend on mathematics. Other books have shown how empty they are
			without it. Students in the arts and humanities need some minimal
			education in math and science in order to communicate with people
			outside their own specialty, to bridge the gap between the “two
			cultures”. A truly educated person is fluent in three languages: (1)
			his native language, (2) a foreign language, needed to appreciate how
			grammar and rhetoric vary, and (3) mathematics, the universal
			language of engineers and scientists. In the modern world, being
			“innumerate” is a deficiency like being illiterate.</p>
		<p>This book is intended to help students learn how to solve
			problems that have numerical answers, with the aid of a scientific
			calculator. It is not intended to serve as preparation for further
			study of mathematics. Exponents and logarithms are included to the
			extent that they are useful. The goal is not  to stimulate deeper
			enquiry, although it is acceptable if that happens. Bits of the
			history of mathematics serve as snacks, not as the main course.</p>
