		<p>Every material object or substance consists of atoms and
			molecules. For the most part, they are too small to be seen, but
			quantitative chemical &#xa0;evidence for their existence is overwhelming.
			As Linus Pauling wrote, &#x201c;Atoms are the units which retain their
			identity when chemical reactions take place.&#x201d; &#xa0;To appreciate events
			in the natural world, including functions of the human body, you
			(yes, you) must have some minimal knowledge of atoms and molecules.
			Even the artistic-creative and poetic sort need this.</p>

		<p>
			A chemical element consists of atoms of only one kind; there are 92
			natural elements, with names like hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen,
			each with a symbol such as H, O, C, N. A chemical compound consists
			of atoms of more than one kind, such as H<sub>2</sub>O = water, CO<sub>2</sub>
			= carbon dioxide, NH<sub>3</sub> = ammonia. These formulas represent
			molecules of compounds. &#xa0;Symbols such as O<sub>2</sub> &#x2013; oxygen or N<span class="T4">2 </span>&#x2013; nitrogen &#xa0;represent molecules composed of two
			atoms of the same element. Molecules are very small, but some are
			sufficiently large that images of them can be made with special
			equipment. Now, the concept of atoms and molecules is beginning to
			make sense to you.
		</p>

		<p>Analysis of the composition of molecules formed in chemical
			reactions has enabled chemists to put the elements in order of atomic
			number in a chart called the periodic table. This is printed in many
			textbooks. Real chemists have it in their heads. The word atom means
			indivisible, but atomic physics has shown that atoms actually have a
			very dense nucleus of protons and neutrons, surrounded by a lot of
			space with fast-moving electrons. Chemical reactions are the result
			of behavior of the outer electrons. &#xa0;Atomic numbers are equal to the
			number of protons in the nucleus of all atoms of a specific element,
			while the sum of protons and neutrons determines the atomic weight.
			These simple facts sound like dogma, and they are. However, their
			origin is not revelation, but rather the result of many experiments
			in many laboratories. If you want to get to the bottom of this dogma,
			take a chemistry course, and question the instructor.</p>

				<div title="The Mole and Molecular Weight">
		<p>Chemists are fond of a quantity called the mole, which is the
			molecular weight (MW) of a substance, taken in grams. The molecular
			weight is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms forming the
			molecule. For example, one mole of water weighs 18 g:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			2 H = 2, &#xa0;O = 16, H<sub>2</sub>O = 18;
		</p>
		<p>one mole of carbon dioxide weighs 44 g:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			C = 12, 2 O = 32, CO<sub>2</sub> = 44. &#xa0;
		</p>
		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 9-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Determine the MW of carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. What
				is the MW of cholesterol, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>52</sub>O ?
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now, consider &#xa0;some really big and really small numbers. The number
			of molecules in a mole = 6.02 X 10<sup>23</sup>; this was determined
			by experiments &#xa0;that were followed by calculations based of the
			charge of an electron:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			1.60 X 10<sup>-10</sup>coulomb
		</p>
		<p>Hey, Jennifer, what is the charge on a mole of electrons? Oh,
			Mike, that is so easy!</p>
		<p class="equation">
			6.2 X 10<sup>23</sup>( 1.60 X 10<sup>-10</sup>) = 9.632 X 10<sup>13</sup>coulombs.
		</p>
		<p>Note that when numbers like this are multiplied, the exponents
			are added. When one number is divided by another, the lower (divisor)
			exponent is subtracted from the upper (dividend) to get the answer
			(quotient). If a mole of water weighs 18.0g, how much does each
			molecule weigh?</p>
		<p class="equation">
			18.0 X 10<sup>0</sup>g / 6.02 X 10<sup>23 </sup>= 2.99 X 10<sup>-23
			</sup>g
		</p>
		<p>There is no way to isolate one molecule of water, nor any
			balance to weigh it. Such questions are really just a way to have fun
			with numbers. &#xa0;Other than a wish to communicate with numbers freaks,
			is there any reason to be familiar with the rules of exponents? With
			the US national debt in the trillions of dollars, and world
			population over six billion, the answer is yes.</p>
		<p class="equation">
			10<sup>6</sup> = 1 million = &#xa0;1 000 000&#xa0; &#xa0;
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			10<sup>9</sup> = 1 billion = &#xa0;1 000 000 000
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			10<sup>12</sup> = 1 trillion = 1 000 000 000 000 &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;
		</p>
		<p>The confusion associated with long strings of zeroes is
			eliminated.</p>

		<p>Numbers with negative powers of ten express small quantities,
			and are reciprocals of the large numbers as follows:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			10<sup>-6</sup> = 1/ 10<sup>6</sup> = 0.000 001 = 1 one-millionth
			part
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			10<sup>-9</sup> = 1/ 10<sup>9</sup> = 0.000 000 001 = 1 one-billionth
			part
		</p>

		<p>In chemistry, it is often more convenient to work with less
			than one mole of a substance, and a terminology has developed to
			describe extra small amounts, such as chemicals in blood, or
			pollutants.</p>
		<p class="equation">
			10<sup>-3</sup> mole is a millimole = mmol
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			10<sup>-6</sup> mole = 1 micromole = &#xb5;mol
		</p>
		<p>
			A micromole is not a tiny burrowing mammal. Molar does not refer to a
			tooth. Molar refers to concentration: a 1 molar solution of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6
			</sub> (MW 180.156) contains 180 grams dissolved in 1 liter. The label on
			the bottle reads 1.0 M glucose.
		</p>

		<p>The blood plasma of a healthy fasting adult contains 0.910 g
			glucose / L. The molar concentration is:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			0.910 g / 180.156 g/mol = 5.05 X 10<sup>-3</sup> M = 5.05 mM.
		</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 9-2.</b>
			</p>
			<p>In a glucose tolerance test, a diabetic patient had a fasting
				level of 1.290 g/L, and a maximum of 2.620 g/L. Express these
				concentrations in mM.</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Below 10<sup>-6</sup> -micro are additional prefixes: 10<sup>-9
			</sup> -nano, and 10<sup>-12</sup> -pico. A normal plasma concentration of
			insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar, may range up to 500
			picomolar:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			500 pM = 500 X 10<sup>-12</sup> M = 0.5 X 10<sup>-9</sup> M = 0.5 nM
		</p>
		<p>Hormones are highly effective at very low concentrations. With
			MW = 5 808, a 1M solution of insulin would contain 5 808 g/L, an
			obvious impossibility, because 5.8 kg cannot dissolve in 1 kg water.
			On the other hand,</p>
		<p class="equation">
			500 pM = 0.5 nM = 0.5 X 10<sup>-9 </sup> X 5.808 X 10<sup>3</sup> =
			2.9 X 10<sup>-6</sup> g/L.
		</p>
		<p>This is a measurable concentration, 2.9 &#xb5;g/L.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 9-3.</b>
			</p>
			<p>The normal level of cholesterol is 2.00 g / L plasma. With the
				molecular weight determined in Exercise 9-1, convert this number
				into a molar concentration.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Clinical laboratories use both mg/dL and mM to express
			concentrations of substances in blood and urine. The results of
			testing your fluids should state the units of concentration. Do not
			pay for diagnostic tests unless the results &#xa0;are stated properly.</p>
