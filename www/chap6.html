				<div title="Interest Calculations">
		<p>Two young people leave their homes to become students at a
			distant school. Each has received the same advice that Polonius gave
			his son Laertes: "Neither a borrower nor a lender be, For loan oft
			loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulleth th'edge of
			husbandry." (Husbandry is careful or thrifty management.) Good
			advice, but away from parental guidance, one becomes a borrower and
			the other a lender.</p>

		<p>Mike throws a party for all his new friends, and charges the
			food and drink on his credit card. Added to his travel and car
			expenses, the bill is staggering, so he pays the minimum, and
			"carries a balance" of $1 000. In effect, Mike has borrowed $1 000
			from the bank that issued the card.</p>

		<p>Jennifer receives a scholarship check from an organization in
			her home town, and deposits $1 000 in a savings account at the same
			bank, making her, in effect, a lender. The consequences can be
			expressed in terms of compound interest paid by Mike, and received by
			Jennifer.</p>

		<p>
			In the compound interest equation, P is the <b>principal</b>, the
			amount on which the calculation of interest is based; S is the <b>sum</b>
			that results from the calculation; i is the <b>interest rate</b>; n
			is the <b>number</b> of days, quarters, or years.
		</p>

		<p>
			S = P ( 1 + i ) <sup>n</sup>
		</p>

		<p>The credit card bill that Mike receives after 30 days shows S,
			the amount he owes. The interest charged on this particular card has
			an annual rate (APR) of 10.240%. Percent means &#x201c;per hundred&#x201d;, so 10%
			= 0.10 in ordinary numbers. The daily rate is:</p>

		<p>
			i = <sup>0.1024</sup>/<sub>365 days/year</sub> = 0.00028050547 / day
		</p>

		<p>
			Use the y <sup>x</sup> key (or x <sup>y</sup> ) to calculate an
			exponential quantity.
		</p>

		<p>
			S = $1 000 (1.00028050547) <sup>30</sup> = $1 000 (1.008450766) = $1
			008.45
		</p>
		<p>Mike now owes $1 000 plus $8.45 interest.</p>


		<p>Jennifer finds interest credited to her account after 30 days.
			It was calculated with APR = 1.25%;</p>

		<p>
			i = <sup>0.0125</sup>/<sub>365</sub> = <sup>0.000034246</sup>/<sub>day</sub>
		</p>
		<p>(Step missing here. Can you supply it?)</p>
		<p>S = $1 000 X 1.0010279 = $1 001.0279</p>

		<p>Her account has grown by $1.03. Compare with the interest paid
			by Mike. Have you ever wondered why there are so many banks?</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 6-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>1. Another depositor has a balance of $16 159 in the same type
				of account as Jennifer. Calculate the amount of interest she
				receives after 30 days.</p>
			<p>2. This woman decides to put the $16 159 into a certificate of
				deposit that credits interest quarterly, at an annual rate = 3.81%
				compounded. How much interest does she receive in one year (4
				quarters)?</p>

		<p>Rates of gain or loss in the value of property can be found
			with a modification of the compound-interest equation, by taking the
			logarithm of both sides, and rearranging:</p>
		<p>
			S = P ( 1 + i ) <sup>n</sup>
		</p>
		<p>log S = log P + n log (1 + i )</p>

		<p>The logarithm of a number is the power of 10 equivalent to that
			number:</p>
		<p>
			1 000 = 10 <sup>3</sup>; &#xa0;log 1 000 = 3. &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;
		</p>
		<p>Repeat after me: A logarithm is an exponent . A logarithm is an
			exponent.</p>
		<p>In the original equation, n is an exponent. Taking logs brings
			it down to earth, into an ordinary number position .</p>

		<p>Next, rearrange:</p>
		<p>log (1+i) = (log S - log P) / n</p>

		<p>
			After finding the value of log (1+i), &#xa0;use the antilog or 10 <sup>x</sup>
			function on the calculator to find 1+i. Then merely subtract 1 to get
			i, the rate of appreciation or depreciation.
		</p>

		<p>For example, a homeowner sells his property for $500 000; he
			bought it 16 years before for $110 000.</p>

		<p>log (1+i) = (log 500 000 - log 110 000)/ 16 y = (5.698970004 -
			5.041392685)/16 = &#xa0;0.041098582</p>
		<p>1+i = antilog 0.041098582 = 1.099255336</p>
		<p>(Subtract 1.)</p>
		<p>&#xa0;i = 0.0992/year = 9.92%/yr</p>

		<p>Of course, this apparent rate of appreciation is partly due to
			inflation, which has varied from 1.3 to 2.9 percent per year in
			recent years.</p>

		<p>Mike's car was bought 8 years ago for $9 950, and now has a
			book value of $2 210.&#xa0;He has appreciated having a car, but the car
			has not appreciated. The depreciation rate is:</p>

		<p>
			log 1+i = <sup>-0.653430807</sup>/<sub>8y</sub> = -0.08167885
		</p>
		<p>1+i = 0.828554631, &#xa0;i = -0.171445368/yr</p>

		<p>His car has depreciated at a rate of 17.1 % per year, an asset
			to his social life, but a poor investment.</p>

		<p>Shares of stock in corporations tend to increase in value in
			the long run (Fig. 6-1). Average selling prices, representative of
			the stock market in general, are reported as S&amp;P 500, Dow-Jones,
			etc. Over some periods, your investment grows rapidly, especially if
			you re-invest dividends instead of spending them. The compound
			interest equation allows calculation of the rate of appreciation. The
			graph shows that $1 invested in 1926 grew to $2 053 in 2001:</p>

		<p>log(1+i) = (log 2 053 - log 1) / 75 = 0.044165185</p>

		<p>1+i = antilog 0.044165185 = 1.107044774</p>

		<p>i = 0.1070 = 10.7 % per year</p>

		<p>The logarithm of a number is the power of 10 equivalent to that
			number. Here is a nice theorem that illustrates the meaning of
			logarithm and the meaning of proof:</p>

		<p>THE LOGARITHM OF 2 IS IRRATIONAL.</p>

		<p>By irrational we mean that it cannot be expressed as a ratio of
			whole numbers, such as &#xbc;, &#xbd;, &#xbe; etc. By logarithm we mean that this
			ratio, if it exists, serves as the exponent of 10.</p>

		<p>&#xa0;Assume that such a ratio of two numbers p and q exists:</p>

		<p>log 2 = p/q</p>
		<p>
			10 <sup>p/q</sup> = 2
		</p>
		<p>Raise both sides to the q power: (pq /q = p)</p>
		<p>
			10 <sup>p</sup>&#xa0;= 2 <sup>q</sup>
		</p>
		<p>This is impossible, because all powers of 10 end in 0, and all
			powers of 2 end in 2, 4, 6, or 8. Therefore, the assumption is wrong.
			Such a ratio cannot exist. QED.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="italics">Quod erat demonstrandum</span> = &#x201c;Which was to
			be demonstrated&#x201d;, a Latin phrase signifying that the proof is
			complete.
		</p>

		<p>There are ratios, such as 31/103 and 497/1651, almost the same
			as log 2, but "not exactly".</p>
		<p>
			<span class="note">QED also stands for quantum electron
				dynamics. Avoid this usage, unless you love physics.</span>
