					<h2>The purpose of this work is to promote fluency in the
						language of mathematics among students who have had little
						experience (or perhaps an unpleasant experience) with standard
						math courses. Every educated person needs to become "numerate",
						not only to solve practical problems, but also to develop paths of
						communication with scientists, physicians, and engineers, whose
						work requires that they think in a quantitative manner.</h2>

				<div title="Radius, Circumference, and Pi">
<p>The radius (r) of a circle is the distance set on your compass
when you draw a circle, and the distance from the center to the boundary
of any circular object. The distance around, or perimeter, is called the
circumference (C), and the straight-line distance across the circle,
through the center, is called the diameter. The diameter (d) is exactly
twice the radius. There is a fixed ratio between the circumference (C)
and the diameter (d), expressed algebraically as <sup>C</sup>&#x2044;<sub>d</sub>.
What, exactly, is the value of this ratio?</p>

<div class="imagediv">Fig. 5-1<br />
<img title="Fig. 5-1" src="images/square-circle.png" /></div>

<p>The number must be less than 4, because the perimeter of a square
that encloses a circle is 4d. See Figure 5-1. The number must be greater
than 3, because when 6 radii are marked off on the circumference, the
straight-line figure inside is a regular hexagon, with perimeter 3d.</p>

<p>Archimedes of Syracuse (Sicily, not New York) was curious about
the precise ratio between C and d. Around 250 BC, he had no calculator
and not even a good number system, but by constructing polygons with
more-and-more sides, and dividing them into triangles, he found a good
approximation of the number, which about 1700 AD came to be called pi
(&#x3c0;) the 16th letter of the Greek alphabet.</p>

<p class="equation"><sup>C</sup>&#x2044;<sub>d</sub> = &#x3c0;, C = &#x3c0;d = 2&#x3c0;r</p>

<p class="equation">3<sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>7</sub> = <sup>22</sup>&#x2044;<sub>7</sub>
&gt; &#x3c0; &gt; 3 <sup>10</sup>&#x2044;<sub>71</sub> = <sup>223</sup>&#x2044;<sub>71</sub></p>

<p>The ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle (&#x3c0;) is
given here as approximately 3<sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>7</sub>, which is
the same as <sup>22</sup>&#x2044;<sub>7</sub>. It is possible to have
fractions between any two whole numbers, not just between 0 and 1. In
principle, the interval between 3 and 4 could be divided in 71 equal
pieces, and we could take 10 of them to make the desired ratio. Thus
&#x3c0; is also about 3<sup>10</sup>&#x2044;<sub>71</sub>.</p>

<p>Although fractions can be precise, and operations with fractions
have simple, well-defined rules, it is often more practical to do
calculations with their decimal equivalents: <sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>4</sub>
= 0.25, <sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>8</sub> = 0.125, <sup>1</sup>&#x2044;<sub>16</sub>
= 0.0625 etc. The decimal equivalent of a fraction is the upper number
(numerator) divided by the lower one (denominator).</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p><b>Exercise 5-1.</b> Find the decimal equivalents of the
Archimedes fractions.</p>
</div>

<p>An average of these two values is very close to the desired
ratio. A closer ratio, <sup>355</sup>&#x2044;<sub>113</sub>, was known to
ancient Chinese astronomers. The value in a scientific calculator is
3.141592654. By playing with numbers, one can find fractions even
closer, such as <sup>12 546 274</sup>&#x2044;<sub>3 993 603.</sub></p>

<p>The value of &#x3c0; can be calculated ever more closely by adding
various series of ever-smaller fractions (discovered by Leibniz and
Euler), a tedious procedure ideally suited to computers. Some people
have become so obsessed with &#x3c0; that they carry calculations to
ridiculous extremes. That is why &#x3c0; is called an irrational number.
No, not really; it is because there is no ratio of whole numbers that
expresses it exactly.</p>

<p><b>Exercise 5-2.</b></p>
<p>1 . A circular pool area has a radius of 2.40 m. What length of
fencing material is needed to enclose it?</p>
<p>2 . The distance around the near-circular Crater Lake, Oregon, is
26.043 km; calculate the distance across it.</p>

<p>The area of a circular space, such as a ring at a three-ring
circus, or the surface of Crater Lake, should be some multiple of its
linear dimension squared. Perhaps the area of a circle is some multiple
of r<sup>2</sup>. Eureka!</p>

<p class="equation">A = &#x3c0;r<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The childish geometrical joke is: &#x201c;Pie r not square, pie are
round.&#x201d; In most languages, however, i has the sound of i in machine.
With an international group, the joker should say, &#x201c;pea are round.&#x201d;</p>

<p>Hagia Sophia in Istanbul (Fig. 5-3) was first built as a church
by Constantius in 360AD, was burned and rebuilt twice, became a mosque,
and is now a museum.</p>

<p><b>Exercise 5-4.</b> The average diameter of the dome of Hagia
Sophia is 31.376m. Calculate the area and the circumference of the
circular floor directly beneath the dome.</p>

<p>A sphere is the solid figure generated by rotating a circle, and
there are many interesting sphere-like objects, such as Earth, for
example. Geometry of the sphere was investigated by Archimedes, and of
course the constant &#x3c0; appears in the equations for volume and surface
of the sphere. See C. 8.</p>
