<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Energy and mass are the most basic concepts of
physics. As new discoveries are made about energy transformations, the
results are put in the form of equations. Physics without math is like
marriage without sex, or breakfast without coffee. The main reason that
the newer physics of relativity is not well understood is that many
people do not know the old physics. Einstein did not discard classical
physics; he modified it to describe events inside of atoms and in outer
space. For events between these extremes, Archimedes and Newton do very
well, thank you.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Both energy and mass are conserved; within a closed
system, there is no net gain or loss. When a home run is hit, there is a
loss of the mass of one baseball, because it has left the system. When a
hot dog is eaten, its physical state has been altered, but it is still
within the system. The work and heat produced by the base runner are not
created by him; they are derived from the chemical bond energy of the
food he has eaten.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;The basic equation for energy relations is: &#x394;G = &#x394;H
- T&#x394;S. &#xa0;&#x394; is the standard symbol for an increment or amount of change. <span class="T1">D</span>G stands for change in free energy, which means
energy available to do work, not a free lunch. The concept was developed
by Willard Gibbs, a professor of physical chemistry at Yale, and
probably the best scientist ever born in America. H is heat; T is
temperature on the absolute or Kelvin scale, and S is entropy, an
indicator of disorder in a system. There is no device for measuring S;
it is always calculated. &#xa0;&#x394;G can be obtained from redox potentials and
from equilibrium concentrations of chemicals in a reaction mixture. &#x394;H
is found from temperature measurements. And I am not making this up. It
is best not to use the word entropy unless you are actually working on
problems in thermodynamics.</p>

				<div title="Joules and Calories">
<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Energy budgets are expressed in joules (jewels, not
jowls), the SI units comparable to calories. 1 joule is the amount of
work done when 1 kg is lifted 1 meter, in other words, the energy
expended to move this weight in opposition to the force of gravity. It
is such a small amount that the answers to energy problems are usually
in kilojoules (kJ).</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Glucose burned in a calorimeter yields the same
products, CO<span class="T2">2</span> and H<span class="T2">2</span>O,
and the same amount of energy, 17 kJ per gram, as glucose metabolized by
living cells. Mass and energy are conserved in both processes.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;For those accustomed to working with calories, the
conversion factor is: &#xa0; &#xa0; 1 kcal = 4.186 kJ. The Calories listed on
cereal boxes are really kcal. The label states that 30 g toasted oats
contains 110 Cal. To compare with the content of glucose above:</p>
<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;110 kcal / 30 g = 3.667 kcal / g; &#xa0;3.667 X 4.186 kJ
/ kcal = 15.35 kJ / g.</p>
<p class="P1">Since cereal is mostly carbohydrate, it is not
surprizing to find a value equal to 90 % of the glucose value.</p>

<p class="P1">Exercise 13-1. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the
&#x201c;average&#x201d; (70-kg) adult male is 7 410 kJ per day.With moderate activity,
the rate &#xa0;rises to &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;11 720 kJ / day. Calculate the weight of oat
cereal needed to maintain these metabolic rates.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Of course, the supply of energy is not the whole
story of human nutrition. &#xa0;Adequate water and salts, essential amino
acids, vitamins, all are important. Also desirable are a good cook and a
pleasant dinner companion.</p>

				<!--

 -->
				<div title="Power">
<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Power is the rate of doing work, expressed as 1 J /
s = 1 Watt. Much of the early work on thermodynamics emerged from the
work of Watt on steam engines. &#xa0;Joule was recognized for his work on the
mechanical equivalent of heat. Cecie Starr wrote that heat production by
humans is similar to the heat output of a 100-Watt light bulb. Since the
number of seconds in a day is: 60 X 60 X 24 = 86 400 s / day, the BMR
above becomes &#xa0;7 410 kJ / 86 400 s = 0.08576 kJ / s = 85.8 W.</p>

<p class="P1">Exercise 13-2. With the metabolic rates above,
calculate the power in Watts of the standard man when moderately active.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;In spite of the equal net effects of combustion and
metabolism, the chemical reactions are totally different. There is no
such thing as a &#x201c;fat-burning&#x201d; fitness scheme. &#xa0;The living machine makes
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) at ordinary body temperature, a molecule
that powers muscular contraction, breaks down in the process, and is
then resynthesized. The &#x394;G of ATP hydrolysis is -30.56 kJ/ mol (-7.3
kcal). &#xa0;By convention, &#x394;G is negative when energy is available to do
work, and positive when energy must be put into the system to produce a
reaction. As Mathews wrote, &#x201c;evolution has created an array of enzymes
that preferentially bind ATP, and</p>
<p class="P1">use its free energy of hydrolysis to drive endergonic
reactions.&#x201d;</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;The empirical formula of ATP is C<span class="T2">10</span>H<span class="T2">16</span>O<span class="T2">13</span>N<span class="T2">5</span>P<span class="T2">3. </span><span class="T3">A</span>dding up all the atomic
weights gives a molecular weight of 507.488; thus 1 mole weighs 506.488
g. Compared to glucose, the energy of ATP is very small:</p>
<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;1 g / 506.488 g/mol X 30.56 kJ/mol = 0.0602 kJ / g.
This emphasizes the point that ATP is not a fuel; it is part of the
cellular machinery, a carrier of chemical bond energy to the sites where
energy is needed.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Large amounts of kinetic energy are released in
explosions. 1 ton of TNT has been reported to release 5 X 10<span class="T4">6 </span>kJ. A ton of 2 000 lbs. is the same as 907.19 kg.
Therefore:</p>
<p class="P1">E = 5.51 kJ / g, about 1/3 as much energy as glucose,
but much greater power, because it is released suddenly.</p>

				<div title="Relativity">
<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;Until 1900, mass and energy were entirely separate
concepts, and the motion of electrons around the nucleus of an atom
resembled a miniature solar system. First the quantum mechanics of Max
Planck, and then the relativity of Albert Einstein, changed all that.
The general public left quantum theory to the physicists, but they loved
the idea of relativity. Einstein did not like the word; he was
interested in absolutes. He liked women, and disliked haircuts (Fig.
13-1), which made caricatures almost too easy (Fig. 13-2). &#xa0;</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;This book is about useful calculations, not
theoretical physics. &#xa0; Interconversions of mass and energy are not
conspicuous features of everyday life, but they do occur. The production
of C-11 in a cyclotron (Chap.10) is an example of conversion of energy
to mass. Conversion of mass to energy occurs in the radioactive decay of
uranium to lead; one intermediate step is the radium-to-radon transition
(Chap. 10). The conversion was first demonstrated conclusively in a
nuclear reactor, then shown in a spectacular way in atomic bombs, and
now occurs regularly in nuclear power plants.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;In the equation E = mc<span class="T4">2</span>, E
is energy (kJ) and m is mass (kg) and c is a constant equal to the speed
of light, 3 X 10<span class="T4">8</span> m/s. Ever since it became
clear that the speed of light can be measured, some physicists have been
interested in obtaining more and more precise values of c, a recent one:
c = 2.99792458 X 10<span class="T4">8</span> m/s. This is only slightly
more practical than calculating <span class="T6">p</span><span class="T5"> </span>to one thousand places.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;The fission of U<span class="T4">238 </span>has
been reported to liberate 200 MeV (million electron volts) per atom.
After several conversion factors are applied, this works out &#xa0;to 8.097 X
10<span class="T4">7</span> kJ/g.</p>
<p class="P1">According to the basic equation:</p>
<p class="P1">E = 0.001 kg (3.0 X 10<span class="T4">8 </span>m/s)<span class="T4">2 </span>= 8.988 X 10<span class="T4">10</span> kJ/g.</p>
<p class="P1">From this, it is apparent that only a small fraction
of the mass of uranium is converted to energy, but that fractional
amount, compared to other energy sources, is enormous.</p>

<p class="P1">Exercise 13-3. Compare the energy content of 1 gram of
toasted oats, TNT, and uranium.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;There is some conversion of mass to energy outside
of nuclear power plants. If a 10-Watt flashlight is left &#x201c;on&#x201d; for a long
time, there is a small loss of mass: &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;10 W = 10 J/s</p>
<p class="P1">m = E/c<span class="T4">2</span> = 10 / (3 X 10<span class="T4">8</span> m/s)<span class="T4">2</span> = 1.1126497 X 10<span class="T4">-16</span> kg &#xa0;per second. &#xa0;</p>
<p class="P1">Seconds in one year = 60 s/min X 60 min/hr X 24 hr/d X
365.2 d/y =</p>
<p class="P1">3.1553 X 10<span class="T4">7</span> s/y.</p>
<p class="P1">&#x394;m/y = 3.1553 X 10<span class="T4">7</span> X 1.113 X
10<span class="T4">-16</span> = 3.5107 X 10<span class="T4">-9</span> kg
= 3.5107 &#xb5;g/y.</p>

<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0;An analytical balance can measure a change of 0.1
mg or 100 micrograms. The time required to make the loss of mass from
the flashlight perceptible:</p>
<p class="P1">&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#x394;t = 100&#xb5;g / 3.5107 &#xb5;g/y = 28.48 years.</p>
<p class="P1">This is really just playing with numbers, a game that
theoretical physicists love to play.</p>
