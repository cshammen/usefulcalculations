		<p>Energy and mass are the most basic concepts of physics. As new
			discoveries are made about energy transformations, the results are
			put in the form of equations. Physics without math is like marriage
			without sex, or breakfast without coffee. The main reason that the
			newer physics of relativity is not well understood is that many
			people do not know the old physics. Einstein did not discard
			classical physics; he modified it to describe events inside of atoms
			and in outer space. For events between these extremes, Archimedes and
			Newton do very well, thank you.</p>

		<p>Both energy and mass are conserved; within a closed system,
			there is no net gain or loss. When a home run is hit, there is a loss
			of the mass of one baseball, because it has left the system. When a
			hot dog is eaten, its physical state has been altered, but it is
			still within the system. The work and heat produced by the base
			runner are not created by him; they are derived from the chemical
			bond energy of the food he has eaten.</p>

		<p>The basic equation for energy relations is: &#x394;G = &#x394;H
			- T&#x394;S. &#xa0;&#x394; is the standard symbol for an increment or
			amount of change. &#x394;G stands for change in free energy, which
			means energy available to do work, not a free lunch. The concept was
			developed by Willard Gibbs, a professor of physical chemistry at
			Yale, and probably the best scientist ever born in America. H is
			heat; T is temperature on the absolute or Kelvin scale, and S is
			entropy, an indicator of disorder in a system. There is no device for
			measuring S; it is always calculated. &#xa0;&#x394;G can be obtained from
			redox potentials and from equilibrium concentrations of chemicals in
			a reaction mixture. &#x394;H is found from temperature measurements.
			And I am not making this up. It is best not to use the word entropy
			unless you are actually working on problems in thermodynamics.</p>

				<div title="Joules and Calories">
		<p>Energy budgets are expressed in joules (jewels, not jowls), the
			SI units comparable to calories. 1 joule is the amount of work done
			when 1 kg is lifted 1 meter, in other words, the energy expended to
			move this weight in opposition to the force of gravity. It is such a
			small amount that the answers to energy problems are usually in
			kilojoules (kJ).</p>

		<p>
			Glucose burned in a calorimeter yields the same products, CO<sub>2</sub>
			and H<sub>2</sub>O, and the same amount of energy, 17 kJ per gram, as
			glucose metabolized by living cells. Mass and energy are conserved in
			both processes.
		</p>

		<p>For those accustomed to working with calories, the conversion
			factor is:</p>
		<p class="equation">1 kcal = 4.186 kJ.</p>

		<p>The Calories listed on cereal boxes are really kcal. The label
			states that 30 g toasted oats contains 110 Cal. To compare with the
			content of glucose above:</p>
		<p class="equation">110 kcal / 30 g = 3.667 kcal / g; &#xa0;3.667 X
			4.186 kJ / kcal = 15.35 kJ / g.</p>
		<p>Since cereal is mostly carbohydrate, it is not surprizing to
			find a value equal to 90 % of the glucose value.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 13-1.</b>
			</p>
			<p>The basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the &#x201c;average&#x201d; (70-kg) adult
				male is 7 410 kJ per day.With moderate activity, the rate &#xa0;rises to
				11 720 kJ / day. Calculate the weight of oat cereal needed to
				maintain these metabolic rates.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Of course, the supply of energy is not the whole story of human
			nutrition. &#xa0;Adequate water and salts, essential amino acids,
			vitamins, all are important. Also desirable are a good cook and a
			pleasant dinner companion.</p>

				<div title="Power">
		<p>Power is the rate of doing work, expressed as 1 J / s = 1 Watt.
			Much of the early work on thermodynamics emerged from the work of
			Watt on steam engines. &#xa0;Joule was recognized for his work on the
			mechanical equivalent of heat. Cecie Starr wrote that heat production
			by humans is similar to the heat output of a 100-Watt light bulb.
			Since the number of seconds in a day is: 60 X 60 X 24 = 86 400 s /
			day, the BMR above becomes &#xa0;7 410 kJ / 86 400 s = 0.08576 kJ / s =
			85.8 W.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 13-2.</b>
			</p>
			<p>With the metabolic rates above, calculate the power in Watts
				of the standard man when moderately active.</p>
		</div>

		<p>In spite of the equal net effects of combustion and metabolism,
			the chemical reactions are totally different. There is no such thing
			as a &#x201c;fat-burning&#x201d; fitness scheme. &#xa0;The living machine makes ATP
			(adenosine triphosphate) at ordinary body temperature, a molecule
			that powers muscular contraction, breaks down in the process, and is
			then resynthesized. The &#x394;G of ATP hydrolysis is -30.56 kJ/ mol
			(-7.3 kcal). &#xa0;By convention, &#x394;G is negative when energy is
			available to do work, and positive when energy must be put into the
			system to produce a reaction. As Mathews wrote, &#x201c;evolution has
			created an array of enzymes that preferentially bind ATP, and use its
			free energy of hydrolysis to drive endergonic reactions.&#x201d;</p>

		<p>
			The empirical formula of ATP is C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>13</sub>N<sub>5</sub>P<sub>3</sub>.
			Adding up all the atomic weights gives a molecular weight of 507.488;
			thus 1 mole weighs 506.488 g. Compared to glucose, the energy of ATP
			is very small:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">1 g / 506.488 g/mol X 30.56 kJ/mol = 0.0602 kJ
			/ g.</p>
		<p>This emphasizes the point that ATP is not a fuel; it is part of
			the cellular machinery, a carrier of chemical bond energy to the
			sites where energy is needed.</p>

		<p>
			Large amounts of kinetic energy are released in explosions. 1 ton of
			TNT has been reported to release 5 X 10<sup>6</sup> kJ. A ton of 2
			000 lbs. is the same as 907.19 kg. Therefore:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">E = 5.51 kJ / g,</p>
		<p>about 1/3 as much energy as glucose, but much greater power,
			because it is released suddenly.</p>

		<p>Until 1900, mass and energy were entirely separate concepts,
			and the motion of electrons around the nucleus of an atom resembled a
			miniature solar system. First the quantum mechanics of Max Planck,
			and then the relativity of Albert Einstein, changed all that. The
			general public left quantum theory to the physicists, but they loved
			the idea of relativity. Einstein did not like the word; he was
			interested in absolutes. He liked women, and disliked haircuts (Fig.
			13-1), which made caricatures almost too easy.</p>

		<p>
			This book is about useful calculations, not theoretical physics. &#xa0;
			Interconversions of mass and energy are not conspicuous features of
			everyday life, but they do occur. The production of C-11 in a
			cyclotron <a href="chap10.html" shape="rect">(Chap.10)</a> is an example of
			conversion of energy to mass. Conversion of mass to energy occurs in
			the radioactive decay of uranium to lead; one intermediate step is
			the radium-to-radon transition <a href="chap10.html" shape="rect">(Chap. 10)</a>.
			The conversion was first demonstrated conclusively in a nuclear
			reactor, then shown in a spectacular way in atomic bombs, and now
			occurs regularly in nuclear power plants.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>, E is energy (kJ) and m is mass
			(kg) and c is a constant equal to the speed of light, 3 X 10<sup>8</sup>
			m/s. Ever since it became clear that the speed of light can be
			measured, some physicists have been interested in obtaining more and
			more precise values of c, a recent one: c = 2.99792458 X 10<sup>8</sup>
			m/s. This is only slightly more practical than calculating &#x3c0; to
			one thousand places.
		</p>

		<p>
			The fission of U<sup>238</sup> has been reported to liberate 200 MeV
			(million electron volts) per atom. After several conversion factors
			are applied, this works out &#xa0;to 8.097 X 10<sup>7</sup> kJ/g.
		</p>
		<p>According to the basic equation:</p>
		<p class="equation">
			E = 0.001 kg (3.0 X 10<sup>8</sup> m/s)<sup>2</sup> = 8.988 X 10<sup>10</sup>
			kJ/g.
		</p>
		<p>From this, it is apparent that only a small fraction of the
			mass of uranium is converted to energy, but that fractional amount,
			compared to other energy sources, is enormous.</p>

		<div class="exercise">
			<p>
				<b>Exercise 13-3.</b>
			</p>
			<p>Compare the energy content of 1 gram of toasted oats, TNT, and
				uranium.</p>
		</div>

		<p>There is some conversion of mass to energy outside of nuclear
			power plants. If a 10-Watt flashlight is left &#x201c;on&#x201d; for a long time,
			there is a small loss of mass:</p>
		<p class="equation">10 W = 10 J/s</p>
		<p class="equation">
			m = E/c<sup>2</sup> = 10 / (3 X 10<sup>8</sup> m/s)<sup>2</sup> =
			1.1126497 X 10<sup>-16</sup> kg &#xa0;per second. &#xa0;
		</p>
		<p>Seconds in one year = 60 s/min X 60 min/hr X 24 hr/d X 365.2
			d/y =</p>
		<p class="equation">
			3.1553 X 10<sup>7</sup> s/y.
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			m/y = 3.1553 X 10<sup>7</sup> X 1.113 X 10<sup>-16</sup> = 3.5107 X
			10<sup>-9</sup> kg = 3.5107 &#xb5;g/y.
		</p>

		<p>An analytical balance can measure a change of 0.1 mg or 100
			micrograms. The time required to make the loss of mass from the
			flashlight perceptible:</p>
		<p class="equation">t = 100&#xb5;g / 3.5107 &#xb5;g/y = 28.48 years.</p>
		<p>This is really just playing with numbers, a game that
			theoretical physicists love to play.</p>
